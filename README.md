Frontend for Nectar app

Nectar adds support for more integrations on [Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com/). Automatically gets data from supported integrations and adds it to Beeminder goals.

This frontend compiles an Android and iOS version of the app, more interfaces to be added at a later date.

Incorporates the [Nectar Backend](https://github.com/beeminder-capstone/Nectar-Backend).

Requires [Cordova and Ionic 2](https://ionicframework.com/getting-started/).

To use Android app - download the APK found in the APK folder. 
[Download](./apk/Nectar.apk)

Enable installation of apps from Unknown Sources in your android device settings.
Install the APK and enjoy!

## Idea
The idea behind this project was to create a clean, user friendly app for customers of Beeminder to use to add any goals using any integrations that Beeminder supports.


## Usage
This app allows the user to do the following things for their Beeminder account
 * Add a goal
     * Manual
     * Using Integration
 * View a Goal
 * Delete a Goal
 
In addition, app notifications are supported, so the user has a choice between the Beeminder emails and regualar app notifications.

## Build
The following instructions will enable you to download and compile the source into a working Android and/or iOS application:



1. Install Node.js: [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    1.  Note: If you are using Windows, you can use Visual Studio and skip most of these instructions: [https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/cordova/?wt.mc_id=o~display~ionic~dn948185](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/cordova/?wt.mc_id=o~display~ionic~dn948185)
2. Install Cordova and Ionic ([http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/)): `npm install -g cordova ionic`.
3. Install the Java Development Kit (JDK): [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
    1. Note: If you are using Windows, you must set some System Environment Variables:
        1. Open “This PC” and find the installation folder for the JDK. Mine was `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_112`.
        2. Open “This PC” > “Properties” > “Advanced system settings”, click “Environment Variables”.
        3. Under “System variables”, click “New”. Type `JAVA_HOME` for the “Variable name” and the path from step i for the “Variable value”.
        4. Under “System variables”, select the `Path` Variable, click “Edit…” > “New”. Type `%JAVA_HOME%\bin`.
4. If installing the Android app, install Android Studio: [https://developer.android.com/studio/install.html](https://developer.android.com/studio/install.html)
5. If installing the iOS app, install Xcode: [https://developer.apple.com/xcode/](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
6. CD into the directory where you want to create the app.
7. Download the files: [https://github.com/beeminder-capstone/Nectar-Frontend](https://github.com/beeminder-capstone/Nectar-Frontend) into the `Nectar-Frontend` directory.
8. Run: `npm install`.
9. Set all environment variables listed in: `src/app/environment-variables/development.ts`.
    1. See this for more info: [https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/01/using-an-oauth-2-0-service-within-an-ionic-2-mobile-app/](https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/01/using-an-oauth-2-0-service-within-an-ionic-2-mobile-app/)
10. If installing the Android app:
    1. Run: `ionic platform add android@latest --save`, it will fail.
    2. Open Android Studio, click “Import project” and select the `Nectar\platforms\android` folder. Install the Android SDK version it recommends on the bottom. Close Android Studio.
        1. Note: Do NOT update the Android Gradle Plugin.
    3. Delete the `Nectar\platforms` folder. Rerun: `ionic platform add android`, it should now succeed.
    4. If you have an Android device (phone/tablet), connect it to your computer and enable “USB debugging”: [https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device.html](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device.html). Run: `ionic run android`.
    5. Otherwise, open Android Studio and click “Run” to setup an emulator (Virtual Device).
11. If installing the iOS app:
    1. Run: `ionic platform add ios`.
