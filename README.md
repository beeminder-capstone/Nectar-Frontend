Nectar adds support for more integrations on [Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com/). Automatically gets data from supported integrations and adds it to Beeminder goals.

This is a work in progress. Incorporates the [Nectar Backend](https://github.com/beeminder-capstone/Nectar-Backend).

Requires [Cordova and Ionic 2](https://ionicframework.com/getting-started/).
